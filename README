Sphynx OS
=========
Sphynx is a sub-modern operating system (idk if i can call it modern, so sub-modern it is).

Features
--------
- PMM, VMM: For memory management.
- IDT, GDT, PIC: For interrupt handling.
- Scheduler: For handling tasks / processes.
- VFS: A virtual file system ABI for handling different file systems.
- ACPI: Unused.
- Ramfs: A pure virtual filesystem loaded in kernel init. This is where the initial env for the OS is.

--------
To build Sphynx simply run 'make' in the root of the repository. I don't know the dependencies, figure it out yourself.

-------
Hardware support is unknown, just run using the 'make run' command in the root of the repository.

License
